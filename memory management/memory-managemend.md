# C++ Memory Management

You can see in the above program that the variable count is declared as static. So, its value is carried through the function calls. The variable count is not getting initialized for every time the function is called.
As a side note, Java doesnâ€™t allow static local variables in functions.
Static variables in a class: As the variables declared as static are initialized only once as they are allocated space in separate static storage so, the static variables in a class are shared by the objects. There can not be multiple copies of same static variables for different objects. Also because of this reason static variables can not be initialized using constructors.

Exercise: Static Method

In addition to static member variables, C++ supports static member functions (or "methods"). Just like static member variables, static member functions are instance-independent: they belong to the class, not to any particular instance of the class.

One corollary to this is that we can method invoke a static member function without ever creating an instance of the class.

You will try just that in this exercise.
